        Secret files with pass-phrase to unlock secret keys.  Keys are
        identified by cacheid, which is either a 40 character keygrip of
        hexadecimal characters identifying the key or an arbitrary string
        identifying a passphrase. Refer to the `gpg-preset-passphrase`
        documentation, because it is what stays behind this mechanism.
        Generally in unattended environments you need to use keygrip.
